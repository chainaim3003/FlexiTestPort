# FlexiTest
Patient-centered, privacy protected testing framework leveraging blockchains and distributed data storage to run a point of care or home test. Objectives are to increase safety for both patients and doctors, to reduce the lead time around current processes, to have identity based provenance, consumer-based consent based data share and de-identified reporting and a privacy-protected minimal proof of safety for use in a possible passport. Working with Lab partners. Initial focus is India, but looking to build as neutral as possible. Need identity experts, d-app developers and REST API.

Thanks for the contributions.
